## Scaled Backstop
This is a version of a pet-project I started at work for me to figure out on my own time.

This also uses individual JSON files for each scenario, which I hope to convert as I go.

This is very similar to backstop_simple, but shows all the functions I attempted.

This will also iterate through scenarios stored in json files  & will be ran with:
- backstop reference --configPath=./backstop.js
- backstop test --configPath=./backstop.js

In this iteration, I'm going to attempt to store "scenario" objects in separate json files

For this iteration, I'm using a demo site to build both page & component based scenarios, https://ultimateqa.com/automation
